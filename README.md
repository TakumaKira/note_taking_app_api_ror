Authentication:

For simplicity, we can omit authentication. However, in a real-world scenario, you would likely add an authentication layer to protect the data.
Error Handling:

Make sure to handle common HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) with appropriate error messages.
This API is quite basic and meant for practice. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider more complex elements like authentication, more robust error handling, data validation, and possibly rate limiting.
